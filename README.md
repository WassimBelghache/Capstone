# Drone-Based Markerless Motion Capture

## Overview
This prototype simulates a motion-capture system that uses drone footage to estimate 3D body kinematics without markers.
Currently, it uses `.trc` motion capture data (RUN.trc, STATIC.trc) as reference.

## Quick Start
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python tests/test_motion_capture.py
